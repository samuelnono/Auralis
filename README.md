## 🌍 Project Overview

Auralis is a frequency- and emotion-aware music recommendation system designed to bridge signal processing and human-centered AI.

Unlike traditional recommender systems that rely only on user behavior, Auralis analyzes:

- Audio frequency features (MFCCs)
- Acoustic characteristics
- Emotion mapping (valence/arousal modeling)
- Similarity-based recommendation logic

The goal is to simulate an interpretable, emotionally intelligent music recommendation architecture.

## 🔬 Core Engineering Components

### 1️⃣ Feature Extraction

Audio is transformed into structured numerical representations using:

- MFCC extraction
- Mean & variance aggregation
- Feature normalization

This allows signal-level comparison across tracks.

---

### 2️⃣ Emotion Modeling

Emotion is predicted using:

- Calm score
- Energetic score
- Happy score
- Sad score

These scores simulate valence-arousal space modeling.

The system prioritizes interpretability over black-box complexity.

---

### 3️⃣ Similarity-Based Recommendation

Recommendations are generated through:

- Cosine similarity
- Distance ranking
- Emotion alignment filtering

This avoids reliance on behavioral tracking and focuses on intrinsic audio structure.

- Lightweight feature extraction
- Efficient vector comparison
- Scalable indexing structure
- Modular architecture for future expansion

Designed to evolve toward:

- Larger dataset indexing
- Hybrid recommendation logic
- Real-time similarity lookup
